# FinShield AI
AI-Powered Credit Card Fraud Detection System

ðŸ“Œ Overview
FinShield AI is a machine learning-powered web application designed to detect fraudulent credit card transactions in real time. The app leverages anomaly detection techniques, visual analytics, and explainable AI (SHAP) to ensure transparency in predictions.

With FinShield AI, financial institutions can:

Prevent losses by detecting suspicious transactions early.

Gain insights into fraud patterns through data visualization.

Understand the reasoning behind AI predictions.

ðŸš€ Features
Real-time Fraud Prediction â€“ Upload transaction data and get instant predictions.

Interactive Visualizations â€“ Explore transaction trends and fraud patterns.

Explainable AI â€“ SHAP values show why a transaction was flagged.

Scalable Model â€“ Uses Logistic Regression / Random Forest for optimal performance.

Streamlit Web Interface â€“ Easy to use for non-technical users.

ðŸ“Š Dataset
This project uses the Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset from Kaggle.

Rows: 284,807 transactions

Features: 30 anonymized features (V1â€“V28, Time, Amount)

Fraud cases: 492 (highly imbalanced)


ðŸ§  How It Works
Preprocessing â€“ Data is scaled using StandardScaler.

Model Training â€“ Logistic Regression / Random Forest trained on transaction data.

Prediction â€“ Model outputs fraud probability (0 = legit, 1 = fraud).

Explainability â€“ SHAP shows feature contributions to each prediction.

ðŸ“Œ Future Improvements
Implement deep learning models for improved accuracy.

Add real-time API for production deployment.

Integrate with banking systems for live transaction monitoring.
